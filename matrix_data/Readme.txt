fragLenOutput: Each row in this file is a sequencing run from a laboratory. The first column is -100th bin. The last column is the 100th bin. Each bin is 200 base pairs long. To calculate bin you take fragment length and divide by 200, then round. What this file contains is essentially the distrbution of fragment lengths in each sequencing run.
